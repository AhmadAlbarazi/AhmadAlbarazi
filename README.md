## 👨🏻 About Me

### As a dedicated student currently pursuing A-Levels Level 3 in IT Data Practitioner at Belfast Met, I am actively honing my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My passion lies in front-end development, and I aspire to leverage my growing proficiency to embark on a remote career as a front-end developer.
### Additionally, I am excited to announce my upcoming journey in 2025/2026 towards a Bachelor of Engineering (BEng) degree in Software Engineering, where I aim to delve into back-end development and further expand my technical expertise. With a keen eye for detail and a drive for innovation, I am committed to contributing to the ever-evolving tech landscape.
